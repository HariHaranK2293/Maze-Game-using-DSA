# Maze Game using DSA in Java

## Overview

This is a simple maze game built in Java using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) principles. The player navigates through a grid with movement options to the right, down, or diagonally, aiming to reach the bottom-right corner. The grid size can be customized according to the user's preference, making it a dynamic and flexible project.

## Features

* Grid Traversal: Navigate a default 5x5 grid, which can be adjusted to any size.
* Movement Options: Move right ('d'), down ('s'), or diagonally ('c').
* Boundary Handling: The system efficiently manages edge conditions, preventing illegal moves.
* Customization: Modify the matrix size by changing the array dimensions in the code.

## How to Play

1. Start at the top-left corner of the grid.
2. Enter movement directions:
 * 'd' for moving right.
 * 's' for moving down.
 * 'c' for moving diagonally (right and down).
3. The game ends when you reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
4. The system keeps track of the total number of moves taken to complete the game.
